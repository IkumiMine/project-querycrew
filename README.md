# Web-App-2

## Project Description
This is a group project. Our goal is to create a dynamic, data-driven website with an appointment booking system for a doctor's office that offers various services. Logged-in patients can visit their dashboard and book an appointment with their desired doctor. Logged-in doctors can edit their profiles and view an upcoming appointment. Logged-in administrators can manage and help doctors and patients by looking at a list of their data, adding, updating, deleting data, and replying to patients' inquiries. These varieties of features ensure a smooth operating experience for the patient, the doctor and the administrators. 

Used: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, jQuery, PHP, MySQL, Fullcalendar, Swiftmailer

## Challenges
I contributed the FAQ page and admin dashboard. Everything that I worked on was a challenge because it was my first time creating a whole database-driven website using bootstrap and libraries (Swiftmailer, Fullcalendar). Another challenge was organizing code. Since the admin dashboard contains multiple functions on one page, the codes got longer and complicated. 

## How I solve the challenges
For bootstrap and libraries, I spent a lot of time searching and figuring out how to implement them on the website. Also, my teammate helped me implementing Swiftmailer. For organizing code, I tried to use classes or separate files for components as much as I could to minimize and reduce redundancy. For example, I included the code for the side menu and admin dashboard in the same file. However, I realized that I needed to use the side menu on the different pages in the admin dashboard, so I created the new file for the side menu only.
